## Digital 3D Models of 3 Mesopotamian Sites  

These are 3D models of parts of three sites in Mesopotamia, created originally for use in virtual reality (VR) teaching during a course on ancient Mesopotamia at the University of Hong Kong in 2022.  We invite you to update these models and redistribute them under the same open license.  

Use of these models in academic publication should include the citation to the following article:

The three sites are Tell Abu Shahrein (ancient Eridu), Umm al-Aqarib (perhaps ancient Umma), Chogha Zanbil.  Different parts of each site are modeled and various models show different periods at each site.     

These were initially modeled by the students Ziqi Song, Zuye Li, Ho Yee Tse, and Ryushi Kiyama. The main softwares used included Rhino3D and Sketchup Pro.
